RAJ (Raj Adam Jason) Group LLC
The RAJ-E-Light-Flippr1 is a convenient, cost-effective, and modular solution to wasted energy. 

## Description
### Introduction:
Want to turn on or off the lights from the comfort of your bed?

Want the lights to turn on automatically as you enter the room?

Always forgetting to turn off the lights when you leave the room?

Don't want the hassle or upfront cost of re-wiring the electrical systems in your building of choice?

RAJ Group LLC's **NEW** _E-Light Flippr1™_ is **THE** smart lighting solution for you! 

### Features:
Using a threefold combo of a handheld infrared remote, infrared receiver, and micro-servo in conjunction with a small microcontroller, the _E-Light Flippr1™_ allows you to simply point the handheld remote in the direction of the light switch to toggle the light switch from afar (or up close)! Furthermore, our state of the art motion detection technology, the _E-Light Flippr1™_ can detect when nobody is around and automatically turn off the lights for you! And if you want to simply toggle the light switch at the wall, the _E-Light Flippr1™_ has a panel-mounted button that effortlessly toggles the switch!

Wondering how it works? When you point the handheld infrared remote at the _E-Light Flippr1™_, the infrared receiver will detect this and send the appropriate signal to our microcontroller. That signal will be processed and relayed through the microcontroller to the servo, which will then flip the switch to the desired state. Also, if no motion has been detected for approximately 3 minutes, the motion sensor will relay a signal to the device, automatically turning off the lights!

### Enclosure Design & Iterations

RAJ Group LLC utilized Autodesk Fusion 360 for the design of the _E-Light Flippr1™_ enclosure. The design was made to be functional, elegant, and compact, with space to hold all of the components listed in the Components section above—including a 10,000mAh battery, which ensures the device can operate on a wall without receiving power for multiple days at a time. In addition, the device supports constant connection via USB-C.

The design was carefully crafted such that the device can be placed exactly over the center of the light switch to toggle it. In addition, the device features curved and filleted edges to allow it to more seamlessly and elegantly add to the aesthetics of the room it is in.

Iteration 1 of our CAD design is shown below:

## Installation
The _E-Light Flippr1™_ is easily installed or detached from a wide range of walls (using velcro, which is strong but not permanent). This means you can automate your light switch worry-free and without worrying about needing to access your house or building’s electrical wiring!
