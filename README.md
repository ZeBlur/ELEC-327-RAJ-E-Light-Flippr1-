# RAJ-E-Light-Flippr1-

Foobar is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.

## Description
### Introduction:
Have you ever been lying in bed, doomscrolling to oblivion after a long day of work, and just thought to yourself, “I just can’t be bothered to turn off the lights”? Well, fear no more! The RAJ™ E-Light Flippr1™ is here!

Want to turn on or off the lights from the comfort of your bed?

Want the lights to turn on automatically as you enter the room?

Wondering what happens if you forget to turn off the lights and then leave the room? 

The RAJ™ E-Light Flippr1™ takes care of that too! 

With our state of the art motion detection technology, the RAJ™ E-Light Flippr1™ can detect when nobody is around and automatically turn off the lights for you!

### Features:
So you’re asking: What is this magical device that can keep me snug in the sheets? Using a threefold combo of a handheld infrared laser, infrared receiver, and micro-servo in conjunction with a small microcontroller, the RAJ™ E-Light Flippr1™ allows you to simply point the handheld laser in the direction of the light switch to toggle the light switch from afar (or up close)! Wondering how it works? When you shine the handheld infrared flashlight at the E-Light Flippr1™, the IR receiver will detect this and send the appropriate signal to our microcontroller. That signal will be processed and relayed through the system to the servo, which will then physically flip the switch to your desired state. Also, if you enter the room, the device will automatically flip the light switch on to turn the lights on. In a similar fashion, after no motion has been detected for a period of time (customizable to the user), the motion sensor will relay a signal to the microcontroller-servo combination, automatically turning off the lights via the servo motor with no extra hassle needed from you! We plan to design our device to be easily installed or detached from a wide range of walls (using velcro, which is strong but not permanent). This means you can automate your light switch worry-free and without worrying about needing to access your house or building’s electrical wiring!
